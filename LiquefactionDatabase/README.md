This folder contains .csv files of the liquefaction case histories used to develop the triggering model. The "testing" data was digitized from Moss et al. (2006) and the "training" data was digitized from Green et al. (2014). This is a somewhat suboptimal method of collecting the data for the model building and it may be necessary to verify the digitization with orignal files from the aformentioned authors.
