# Probabilistic Models for Estimating Sesimic Soil Liquefaction Potential Using CPT Data
This repository contains code and data for estimating novel liquefaction tirggering models developed on the Next Generation Liquefaction (NGL) project case histories. Our project primarily uses R and Stan to fit the models and visualize results. Readers that are not familiar with probablistic modeling and Bayesian inference may be interested in references such as *Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis* by Box and Tiao (1973), *Bayesian Data Analysis* by Gelman et al. (2020), and *Statistical Rethinking* by McElreath (2015). The latter two texts contain examples in R and Stan. The documenation available on https://www.mc-stan.org/ is an excellent starting point for users unfamiliar with Stan but familar with probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference.
