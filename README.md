# A Bayesian Hierachical Model for Estimating Sesimic Soil Liquefaction Potential Using CPT Data
This repository contains code and data for estimating the models described in Schmidt and Moss (2020), and Schmidt (2020). Our project primarily uses R and Stan. The documenation available on mc-stan.org is an excellent starting point for users unfamiliar with Stan but familar with probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference. Readers that are not familiar with probablistic modeling and Bayesian inference may be interested in references such as *Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis* by Box and Tiao (1973), *Bayesian Data Analysis* by Gelman et al. (2020), and *Statistical Rethinking* by McElreath (2015). The latter two texts contain examples in R and Stan.
